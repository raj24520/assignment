	<div id="box">
		<div id="yellow"><h2>BOX-MODEL</h2>
		<p>*The CSS box model is a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of margins, border, padding and the actual content.</p>
		<p>*It is used to develop the design and structure of a web page. It can be used as a set of tools to personalize the layout of different components.</p>
		<p>*Basically, it is a compartment that includes numerous assets, such as edges, border, padding and material.</p>

		<b>THE BOX MODEL CONTAINS DIFFERENT PROPERTIES. SOME OF THEM ARE LISTED BELOW:</b>
		<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
			<li><b>MARGIN FIELD</b></li>
			<p>This segment consists of the area between the boundary and the edge of the border. This margin is transparent. This is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding and border as whitespace between this box and other elements. </p>
			<li><b>BORDER FIELD</b></li>
			<p>It is a region between the padding field and the margin. Its dimensions are determined by the width and height of the boundary.</p>
			<li><b>PADDING FIELD</b></li>
			<p>It includes the element's padding. This area is actually the space around the content area and within the border area. Its dimensions are given by the width of the padding box and the height of the padding box.</p> 
			<li><b>CONTENT AREA</b></li>
			<p>This area consists of content like text, image, or other media content. It is bounded by the content edge and its dimensions are given by content box width and height.</p>
		</ul>

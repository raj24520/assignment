<H1>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</H1>
<span class="Big">A <span class="ad">programming language</span> is a formal language comprising a set of <span class="sd">strings</span> that produce various kinds of machine code output. <span class="ad">Programming languages</span> are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.</span>

<span class="Big"><p>Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. Since the early 1800s, programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos.</p> The programs for these machines <span class="ad">(such as a player piano's scrolls)</span> did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions.</span>

<span class="Big">Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. Many programming languages are written in an imperative form <span class="ad">(i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform)</span> while other languages use the declarative form <span class="ad">(i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).</span></span>

<span class="Big">The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics <span class="ad">(meaning)</span>. <p>Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages <span class="ad">(such as Perl)</span> have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.</p></span>

<span class="Big">Programming language theory is a subfield of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages. A <span class="ad">programming language</span> is a notation for writing programs, which are specifications of a computation or algorithm. Some authors restrict the term <span class="ad">"programming language"</span> to those languages that can express all possible algorithms.</span>

	<P>The <span class="ad">HyperText Markup Language</span>, or <span class="ad">HTML</span> is the standard <span class="sd">markup language</span> for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as <span class="ad sd">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</span> and scripting languages such as <span class="ad sd">JavaScript</span>.Web browsers receive <span class="ad">HTML</span> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <span class="ad">HTML</span> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

<p><span class="ad">HTML</span> elements are the <span class="sd">building blocks of HTML pages</span>. With <span class="ad">HTML</span> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <span class="ad">HTML</span> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as <span class="ad sd">headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items</span>. <span class="ad">HTML</span> elements are delineated by <span class="ad">tags</span>, written using <span class="ad">angle brackets.</P>

<P><span class="ad">HTML</span> can embed programs written in a scripting language such as <span class="ad sd">JavaScript</span>, which affects the <span class="ad sd">behavior and content</span> of web pages. Inclusion of <span class="ad">CSS</span> defines the look and layout of content. The <span class="ad sd">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</span>, former maintainer of the <span class="ad">HTML</span> and current maintainer of the <span class="ad">CSS</span> standards, has encouraged the use of <span class="ad">CSS</span> over explicit presentational <span class="ad">HTML</span> since <span class="ad">1997</span>.</P>
